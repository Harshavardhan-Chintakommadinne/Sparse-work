# Sparse Matrix Array Implementation in C++

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Sparse Matrix** using an **array-based representation** in C++.  
A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most elements are zero. Instead of storing all elements,  
we store only the **non-zero elements** along with their row and column indices.  

This implementation supports:
- Representing sparse matrices efficiently.  
- Displaying sparse matrices in full 2D form.  
- Adding two sparse matrices with matching dimensions.  
- Dynamic memory allocation for elements.

##  Features
- **Efficient Storage:** Stores only non-zero values using a struct (`row`, `col`, `value`).  
- **Dynamic Allocation:** Works with matrices of different sizes.  
- **Matrix Addition:** Supports addition of two sparse matrices.  
- **User Input:** Allows entering non-zero elements manually.  
- **Full Display:** Prints the matrix in standard 2D grid form.
